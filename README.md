# TerraNet Client Onboarding MVP

This project contains the early MVP for the TerraNet Client Onboarding system.

It includes:
- A FastAPI backend for pricing and quote generation  
- A static HTML/JS frontend for drawing fields and previewing quotes  
- A simple flow for calculating TerraNet program pricing based on acres
- Backend structure for payment processing and 
Dev Team Instructions

1. Clone the Project

```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/emcgregor02/TerraNetClientOnboarding.git
cd TerraNetClientOnboarding

2. Create & Activate a Python Virtual Environment
macOS / Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Windows (PowerShell):
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Backend Dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-dotenv
Or, if a requirements file exists:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Backend Server
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
You should see:
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Test the API:
Health check → http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
API docs → http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

5. Open the Frontend

The frontend is a static HTML file. Open it directly in your browser:
TerraNetClientOnboarding/frontend/TCV_V1.html
Just double-click the file or open from within PyCharm.

6. How the System Works

User draws fields on the map
Frontend stores fields in localStorage
Whenever fields are added, deleted, or loaded, the frontend sends a POST request to: POST /quote/preview

Backend returns TerraNet pricing:
annual_total
sprayer_fee
total_due_first_year
per-field line items
Frontend updates the summary using backend data.

7. CORS Configuration

The backend allows requests from local development environments:

origins = [
    "http://localhost:63342",
    "http://127.0.0.1:63342"
]


If you open the frontend using a different localhost port, add it to origins.

8. Troubleshooting
“Refused to connect”

Backend is not running. Start it with:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

“Blocked by CORS policy”

Add your frontend origin to origins in main.py.

“ModuleNotFoundError”

Upgrade tooling:

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

uvicorn[standard] fails on macOS

Use:

pip install uvicorn

10. MVP Roadmap 
Add program selection UI (REMOTE_ONLY vs SPRAYER_PLUS_REMOTE)
Add grower info form (name, email, farm, address)
Generate & export quote PDFs
Save quotes to local HQ server
Optional: deploy backend to HQ workstation

✔ Ready to Develop

Once the backend is running and the frontend is open in a browser:
Draw a field
Save it

Console will show:
“Sending quote payload”
“Quote received”
The system is fully wired for pricing previews.

Or if you’re ready, we can resume building tomorrow exactly where we left off.
